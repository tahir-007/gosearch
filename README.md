# GoSearch - Your Ultimate Search Engine

oSearch is a powerful search engine built on top of the Bing Websearch API. It provides fast and accurate search results for web pages, news articles, images, and videos.

As the developer of this project, I utilized my expertise in Python and the Bing Websearch API to create a user-friendly interface and optimize search algorithms for maximum efficiency. The result is a reliable and comprehensive search engine that delivers relevant results to users.

This project showcases my technical skills in utilizing APIs and programming languages to create a functional and user-friendly product. It also highlights my ability to work independently and take initiative in developing a project from concept to completion.
